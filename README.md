# Benchmark Models

# Introduction
Benchmarking models refers to the practice of evaluating and comparing the performance of various machine learning models on a specific dataset or a set of tasks. This process helps in identifying the best model for a given problem based on predefined metrics. Benchmarking is crucial for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different models and for making informed decisions on model selection.

# Why Benchmark Models?
- Performance Comparison: Benchmarking allows you to compare the performance of different models on the same dataset, ensuring a fair comparison.
- Model Selection: It helps in selecting the most appropriate model for a specific task based on performance metrics.
- Understanding Trade-offs: Benchmarking highlights the trade-offs between different models, such as accuracy, computational efficiency, and complexity.
- Reproducibility: Establishing benchmarks ensures that model performance can be reproduced and verified by others.

# Key Concepts
- Metrics:
Metrics are quantitative measures used to evaluate the performance of models. Common metrics include:
- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
- Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made.
- Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

- Datasets:
Datasets are collections of data used for training and evaluating models. They are usually divided into:
- Training Set: Used to train the model.
- Validation Set: Used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance during training.
- Test Set: Used to assess the final performance of the model.

- Models:
Different deep learning models have different strengths and weaknesses. Common models used in benchmarking include:
- Resnet152 
- EfficientNetV2L 
- CoAtNet 
- Pyramid-Net 
- ViT-B/16(pytorch) 
- Resnet50 
- Resnet101 
- Vgg16 
- CNN 
- Densenet121 


# Steps for Benchmarking
- Select Datasets: Choose the datasets that are representative of the problem you want to solve.
- Choose Metrics: Define the metrics that will be used to evaluate model performance.
- Train Models: Train different models on the training dataset.
- Evaluate Models: Evaluate the trained models on the validation and test datasets using the chosen metrics.
- Compare Results: Compare the performance of the models based on the evaluation metrics.
- Select Best Model: Choose the model that performs the best according to the predefined criteria.
